This script easily help you to search some information about history failures in private log file based on Serial Number.
There is private access (writing - few ppl, others - reading) excel file of alarm logs. This script returns some information from the excel file based on Serial Number of the equipment where alarm was raised.
The script solves two main tasks:

1. You can easily find alarm logs for specific equipment - just put SN in the script.
2. It's not necessary to change the private access to search in the file.
